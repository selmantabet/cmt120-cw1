"Appear weak when you are strong, and strong when you are weak."

"The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting."

"If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle."
